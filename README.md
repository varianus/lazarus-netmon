#lazarus-netmon

This is a quick and dirty project I've written to monitor speed and connection time for my USB 3G Modem under Linux.
The application is written in Lazarus/FPC and I use it daily on my Xubuntu.

This project contains a daemon, a commandline client and a gui app with charts

##daemon
This daemon is automatically started by an upstart job when the modem connection begin.
It expose a D-BUS interface

##client



##gui
